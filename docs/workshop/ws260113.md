# Workshop January 13, 2026

## Agenda

* Given some general insights about the overall Devops Architecture
  * What tools are use
  * How everything sticks together
  * Branching/Versions
  * Testing
  * AWS
* Difference between Gitlab vs Github
  * Basically what to expect
  * What is similar .. What is new
* Github in detail
  * Github Actions
  * Showing a demo how thinks come together
  * How thinks can be tested local
  * How thinks can be deployed to AWS
* Co-Pilot or AI in general
  * How Co-Pilot can and should be used
  * What is about other AI platforms
  * How this can help on the code writing part
  * How this helps for infrastructure

First Feedback Troels:

* Given some general insights about the overall Devops Architecture
  * Here you can link it to our Test Strategy and our branching strategy (align with Prakash)
* Difference between Gitlab vs Github
  * This is expert team, so you can avoid the basic, and go to the advanced differences
* Github in detail
  * If you can spice this with exercises to create first pipelines, that would be good
* Co-Pilot or AI in general
  * As above, if we can include exercises here, it would be good.
  * If it does Agentic AI, that would be interesting to learn about as well
  * We could aim at migrating a sample code so that we can code and make test cases against that sample product (ask Casper)
  * We should not open the door for other AI tools this time. Co-Pilot is selected and we should introduce that now. Then an evaluation can be done another time.

Chapters:

* [Devops Architecture Documentation](devops_architecture.md)
* [GitHub vs GitLab](github_and_gitlab.md)
* [GitHub Actions Deep Dive](github_actions_deep_dive.md)
* [AI Tools and GitHub Co-Pilot](ai_tools_and_github_copilot.md)

## Notes

Documentation:

* base is written in markdown
* can be published to pages or wiki

Guidelines

* write down concrete guidelines (e.g. where are the actions are coming from? Who is responsible?)
* define how to use bin-repos and which stages are necessary
* as input for int-pipelines we need to be able to define which other component versions should be used

Branching and Versioning

* it might be difficult to follow strict github/git-flow strategies
* we need to define how to handle hotfixes and patches
* we need to define how to handle dependencies between components (e.g. component A needs version >=x.y.z of component B)
  
Hands-on session notes:

* User onboarding process needs to be improved
* Users often lags permissions for repos
* A best practice for mono-repos need to be defined
  * Where are the dockerfiles and helm charts located
  * How to structure the folders
* Also multi-repos need to be considered
* Define best practices for secrets management
* The final kubernetes infrastructure needs to be defined:
  * E.g. ingress vs api-gateway
  * Will it be AKS
  * How access is managed
  * Separation e.g. by cluster or namespace
* How to handle 3th party components
  * using public helm charts vs hosting own charts
  * where to store the container images and helm charts (e.g. JFrog Artifactory)
* create a central repository to share github action across the repos
* Create a full best practice example github pipeline including:
  * code checkout
  * build
  * unit tests
  * code quality scan (e.g. SonarQube)
  * publish container image to artifact repo (e.g. JFrog Artifactory)
  * deploy to kubernetes using helm charts
  * integration tests
* Come up with a final decision about ArgoCD vs FluxCD vs plain helm for deployment to kubernetes
* Guidelines about responsibilities and ownership of the pipelines
  * How the DevOps team can support the development teams
  * A transparent approach where teams can see all repos is needed
* Private runner integration
  * how to setup
  * best practices
  * security aspects
  * access to resources in private network
* Workspaces for developers
  * Devcontainers vs Codespaces vs DevBoxes
*
