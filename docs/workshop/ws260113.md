# Workshop January 13, 2026

## Agenda

* Given some general insights about the overall Devops Architecture
  * What tools are use
  * How everything sticks together
  * Branching/Versions
  * Testing
  * AWS
* Difference between Gitlab vs Github
  * Basically what to expect
  * What is similar .. What is new
* Github in detail
  * Github Actions
  * Showing a demo how thinks come together
  * How thinks can be tested local
  * How thinks can be deployed to AWS
* Co-Pilot or AI in general
  * How Co-Pilot can and should be used
  * What is about other AI platforms
  * How this can help on the code writing part
  * How this helps for infrastructure

First Feedback Troels:

* Given some general insights about the overall Devops Architecture
  * Here you can link it to our Test Strategy and our branching strategy (align with Prakash)
* Difference between Gitlab vs Github
  * This is expert team, so you can avoid the basic, and go to the advanced differences
* Github in detail
  * If you can spice this with exercises to create first pipelines, that would be good
* Co-Pilot or AI in general
  * As above, if we can include exercises here, it would be good.
  * If it does Agentic AI, that would be interesting to learn about as well
  * We could aim at migrating a sample code so that we can code and make test cases against that sample product (ask Casper)
  * We should not open the door for other AI tools this time. Co-Pilot is selected and we should introduce that now. Then an evaluation can be done another time.
