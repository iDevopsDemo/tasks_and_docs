## Answers and Notes

* Energy Gitlab
  * No common root group yet
  * more like just a shirtf towards gitlab not many changes done because of the final move towards Github
* Energy Github
  * Cloud Infrastructure team is setting up the initial org and repos
* AWS Account

  * 1 account
  * Security scanning
    * Snyk is used for scanning
    * Trivy can be used as well
* Security Scanning
  * Snyk is used for scanning
  * Trivy can be used as well
* manage AWS account via Github!
* Show hoe umbrella-helm charts can be used to manage multiple services vs. GitOps (ArgoCD)
* AI
  * start low
* Backstage:
  * Would be nice but not yet offical supported by mysite360
  * Contract Testing
* Containerization
  * only ART-C using containers currently
  * Done by 10%
  * Microservices might needs to be explained
  * Code towards .net core to support linux containers
* Artifactory structure
  * best practices from jfrog
  * how to structure
  * multi stage repos
    * nowadays it is used to go to psite
    * for vsides often fake data are used but needs to be tested once on psites with real data
* Release Portal
* Testing Strategy (coming from version 1.0)
  * needs to merged from version 1.0 to 2.0
  * Acceptance tests
* Debugging
  * .net aspire (70%+ gets covered)
