## Notes Florian

=======================================================ORG SETUP=======================================================

* Art E: Basic platform with dependency problems (Central services, Messaging broker) => Will be potentially replaced
* Art A-D: Subcomponents => Every art providing one or many SVCs (future containers)
* Art C (Casper)

=======================================================GENERAL GOALS===================================================

* more containers less coupled system => more easily deployed
* enable the dev teams to work on value creation and feature development
* currently teams are annoyed from technical and process changes => 
  * high maturity from the beginning
  * proper monitoring
* integrate security into CI/CD approach

=======================================================CURRENT PLAN===================================================

System version 2.0 is going to be migrated to a new setup. No impact/change for version 1

Define templates and reusables for all teams
Rework entire CI/CD architecture
Consult on organisational setup/responsibilities

Each SVC (separate repository):

* semver versioning
* sonarqube
* build containers
* artifactory (including improved structure)
* GitOps approach (somehow enforced by IT?)
* deployment and orchestration for tests on AWS EKS

Unclear:

* dependency mgmt via renovate (GitHub alternative)
* clearing via SW 360 (other clearing alternative)

Security goals:
 => security team being involved
 => enable continues lifecycle mgmt (vulnerability scanning & change requests)
 => define workflow for handling security exceptions/accepting risks (e.g. for testing)

Use components from central Energy IT service:

* GitHub on-prem (still in procurement; rollout in december?)
* Runners on Azure

Central DevSecOps teams (???):

* taking care of environment monitoring
* handling team requests
* Casper & Prakash

Final productive deployment (???):

* k8s on-site
* some components in cloud? (connectivity?)

=======================================================POTENTIAL ISSUES/PAIN POINTS/CONTRAINTS========================

Product architecture:

* decoupling
* windows binary => Linux containers

Connectivity/Networking:

* Runners on Azure
* GitHub on prem
* K8s on AWS
* Artifactory
* P-sites

Secret mgmt:

* configuration/secrets
* access from on-site => rely on on-prem compatible services

Central IT team:

* generally a good approach for light-weight applications <=> change mgmt for complex setups

=======================================================PROCESS & WORKFLOW Considerations==============================

* ACP classification (if needed)
* Testing
* Security lifecycle mgmt

=======================================================TESTING========================================================

Requirements:

* decoupling
* low effort for dev teams to spin-up test environments for experimentations

Integration or Unit test:

* create value without interacting with everything -> heavily rely on stubbing

High-level System test:

* time of execution unclear
* dependencies to other SVCs
* (potentially) handling of parts not yet migrated to Linux containers

Hardware involved:

* currently P-sites are used for full acceptance test 1 release after the product development
 => to be (partially) integrate in automated tests

## Notes Lars

* RenovateBot
* SonarCube
* Artifactory
* Github Enterprise (Dez.)

-----

* P-Sites
* Platform might be mocked ...
* k8s - basic usage ...
* Security should be in the pipeline
  * Vunability mangmt
  * RenovateBot
  * Artifactory
  * Blackduck
  * Prozess-Workflow...

-----

* signing of containers ...
* secret manager (Jan boar)
  * Might be only on site
  * how to deploy them towards k8s ()
* GitOps
  *
* Workflow in Artifactory ()
  * maybe addressed by github action ...
